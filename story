When an NGINX server receives a request from a browser in a WordPress setup that uses FastCGI for PHP processing, and the connection is secured with TLS and a CA certificate, a lot of processes take place. Here's a detailed breakdown of how all these components (NGINX, WordPress, FastCGI, TLS, and CA) work together when NGINX handles a request from a browser:

1. Receiving the HTTP Request with TLS (HTTPS)
When the client (e.g., a web browser) sends an HTTPS request to the NGINX server, the first thing that happens is the TLS handshake. Here’s what happens step by step:

The browser initiates a secure connection to the NGINX server using HTTPS.
The browser and server negotiate the version of TLS to use (TLS 1.3 or 1.2) and agree on a cipher suite to ensure that data is securely encrypted during transmission.
NGINX responds with its SSL/TLS certificate, which is usually signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). The certificate contains the server’s public key.
The browser verifies that the certificate is valid and trusted (i.e., it was issued by a trusted CA). If everything checks out, the browser and NGINX proceed to create a session key for encrypting data.
A secure channel is established, and the browser sends its request (e.g., asking for the WordPress homepage) over this encrypted connection.
2. Handling the Request in NGINX
Once the TLS handshake is completed, NGINX receives the actual HTTP request from the browser, typically a GET or POST request to load a WordPress page.

Routing: NGINX checks its configuration to determine how to route the request. This configuration is defined in the NGINX config file (nginx.conf or sites-available/your-site.conf).
If the request is for static content (like images, CSS, or JavaScript files), NGINX may serve it directly from the file system.
For dynamic content (such as WordPress pages that need PHP processing), NGINX will pass the request to FastCGI for PHP execution.
3. FastCGI and PHP Execution
NGINX doesn’t execute PHP scripts directly. Instead, it forwards the request to a FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM), which handles PHP processing.

Here’s what happens in this phase:

NGINX forwards the request (e.g., for a WordPress page) to PHP-FPM using the FastCGI protocol. The FastCGI connection is usually defined in the NGINX configuration like this:
css
Copy code
location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/html$fastcgi_script_name;
    include fastcgi_params;
}
PHP-FPM reads the request and processes the corresponding PHP script (in this case, WordPress PHP files).
WordPress runs its logic, querying the MariaDB database (which stores the WordPress content) for the required data (like the blog posts, pages, user info, etc.).
After the PHP script is executed, PHP-FPM sends the dynamically generated HTML back to NGINX via FastCGI.
4. WordPress and Database Interaction (MariaDB)
WordPress is a PHP-based application, so when the PHP scripts are executed (via FastCGI), WordPress communicates with the MariaDB database to retrieve or store information.
WordPress queries the MariaDB database to fetch content like blog posts, pages, or other dynamic data stored in the database. For example, if the browser requested the homepage, WordPress would retrieve the necessary data (post titles, descriptions, etc.) from the database.
After the data is fetched, WordPress generates the required HTML.
5. NGINX Sending the Response
Once NGINX receives the processed content (HTML) from PHP-FPM, it sends the HTML content back to the browser over the encrypted TLS connection. Here’s the flow:

NGINX collects the response generated by WordPress (through PHP-FPM).
It prepares the HTTP response and sends it back to the browser.
The response travels over the same encrypted TLS connection established earlier, ensuring that the data remains secure.
6. Browser Displays the Content
The browser receives the HTML and other resources (like CSS and JavaScript files) from the NGINX server.
The browser renders the page and displays the requested WordPress content to the user.
Summary of Key Components in the Process
TLS and CA:

TLS ensures that the connection is secure, and the CA certificate is used to verify that the server is trusted.
The session key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data sent between the browser and server.
NGINX:

Acts as a reverse proxy and handles routing requests. It serves static files directly and forwards dynamic requests to FastCGI (PHP-FPM).
FastCGI and PHP-FPM:

FastCGI allows NGINX to communicate with PHP-FPM, which executes the PHP code.
PHP-FPM runs WordPress’s PHP scripts, which then interact with the MariaDB database.
MariaDB:

The database stores all of the WordPress data (posts, pages, users, settings).
WordPress queries the database to fetch or update content based on the request.
Response Handling:

NGINX receives the processed content (HTML) from PHP-FPM and sends it back to the client over the secure connection.
This is the complete flow when a browser requests a WordPress page hosted behind NGINX with FastCGI for PHP processing, using a secure TLS connection.
